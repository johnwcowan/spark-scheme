======

Spark-Scheme is a dialect of Lisp, derived from MzScheme. It has powerful meta-programing facilities that enable the dynamic extension of the core language itself. It adds a whole new dimension to distributed computing with ''concurrent objects''. It is easy to learn and helps the fast 
development of concise, correct programs.

Spark-Scheme is also a Virtual Operating System that can be hosted on GNU/Linux, BSD and Windows (Cygwin). It has libraries to access the file system and the network. It has an advanced GUI framework with 2D/3D graphics rendering capabilities. It can be easily interfaced with databases. It also has frameworks for developing web applications. It can make use of existing C/C++ libraries without the aid of special low-level interfacing code.
