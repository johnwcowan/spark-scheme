Spark is an expressive, dynamic programming language based 
on the [WWW]Scheme language specification. It is derived from MzScheme. 
Spark is a reflective, multi-paradigm language with strong support 
for explorative programming. On top of its functional core you can 
write programs in imperative, object-oriented or just about any style 
you like. Spark adds a whole new dimension to distributed computing
with ''concurrent objects'' and message passing. 
It is easy to learn and facilitates writing concise, correct programs.
